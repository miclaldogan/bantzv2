## 2024-05-18 - [Optimized process scanning with os.scandir]
**Learning:** For high-performance I/O loops iterating over large directories like `/proc` in Python, `os.scandir()` is measurably faster than `os.listdir()` and `pathlib.Path.iterdir()`. `os.scandir()` yields cached `DirEntry` objects instead of allocating a full list of strings upfront, reducing object instantiation overhead.
**Action:** Use `with os.scandir(path) as it: for entry in it:` when scanning thousands of files/directories, especially if only checking properties like `entry.name.isdigit()` or `entry.is_dir()`.
