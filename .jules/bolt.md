## 2024-05-18 - [Optimized process scanning with os.scandir]
**Learning:** For high-performance I/O loops iterating over large directories like `/proc` in Python, `os.scandir()` is measurably faster than `os.listdir()` and `pathlib.Path.iterdir()`. `os.scandir()` yields cached `DirEntry` objects instead of allocating a full list of strings upfront, reducing object instantiation overhead.
**Action:** Use `with os.scandir(path) as it: for entry in it:` when scanning thousands of files/directories, especially if only checking properties like `entry.name.isdigit()` or `entry.is_dir()`.

## 2024-05-18 - [SQLite Bulk Insertion Optimization]
**Learning:** In `src/bantz/data/migration.py`, data migration functions were looping over dictionaries and running `conn.execute(...)` for each key-value pair or list element. This creates a classic N+1 query performance bottleneck when migrating large datasets.
**Action:** Replace `conn.execute(...)` loops with a list comprehension paired with `conn.executemany(...)` to run the operations in bulk, reducing database round-trips and significantly improving data loading performance.

## 2024-05-18 - [SQLite Table Existence Check Optimization]
**Learning:** To check if a table is empty or has data in SQLite, `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table` performs an O(N) full table/index scan. This becomes a performance bottleneck as the table grows.
**Action:** Use `SELECT 1 FROM table LIMIT 1` combined with `fetchone() is not None` instead. This is an O(1) operation that returns immediately after finding the first row, avoiding full scans.
## 2024-05-18 - [Concurrent async health checks]
**Learning:** In async application startup sequences or health check routines, performing multiple network requests sequentially (e.g., using `async with httpx.AsyncClient() as c:` repeatedly in a loop or sequential block) forces the application to wait for the sum of all response latencies. This can cause significant blocking during startup, especially if any service is down and hits a timeout.
**Action:** Extract individual checks into separate async functions, use a single shared `httpx.AsyncClient` context manager, and execute the checks concurrently using `asyncio.gather(...)`. This reduces total execution time to the duration of the slowest single request, drastically improving performance.
